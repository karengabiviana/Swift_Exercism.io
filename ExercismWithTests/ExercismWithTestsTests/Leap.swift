//*Instructions*
//Given a year, report if it is a leap year.
//
//The tricky thing here is that a leap year in the Gregorian calendar occurs:
//on every year that is evenly divisible by 4
//  except every year that is evenly divisible by 100
//    unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400

//For example, 1997 is not a leap year, but 1996 is. 1900 is not a leap year, but 2000 is.

class Year {
    // Write your code for the 'Leap' exercise in this file.
}

class LeapTests: XCTestCase {
    // Write your tests for the 'Leap' exercise in this file.
}
